To test the units separately, we need the following:

1  use command line : csc Employee.cs   to compile c# file outside unity
    write a makefile to do this   
    
2  write a main function in the .cs file you want to test

3  move all the unityengine reference from the unit except Control.cs, 
    which means moving all the Debug.Log to the Control.cs 
    so that we can compile without refer to unity

    In these units, Console.writeline() can be used to print some thing out,
    but Debug.Log should still be kept in Control.cs to test the whole program

c# compiler installation

1 Windows
   download windows.net which is probably already there
   include the   C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319 
  ( or some directory smiliar containing csc.exe )
   to the system environment variable path

2 Mac
    using mono to compile c# file
    You can install it with homebrew:
	brew install mono
    Then you can use it with:
	mcs hello.cs
	mono hello.exe
